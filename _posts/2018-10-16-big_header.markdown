Coming from a background where I already speak 4 languages, I created a special interest in coding while working in the  Apple Office in New York City, I was hired as an contractor for the position Dutch Map Analyst / Editor, it all started there I become very curious about coding and started asking question and researching about it, so I started to look for a school and found Flat Iron! My manager at Apple suggested me Flatiron as well. I wanna create, explore, inspire, code programs and think creative and also use my languages. I asked myself one question one day: what do I really like to do? What would I do if I wouldnt get paid. I love solving puzzles, and its very fun so to the question "Why should I become a software engineer? becease I believe that this is something I have passion for and the idea of developing, to help solve a real life problem with the help of technology motivates me.

Here are my important reasons why?

Computers = Future meaning touches aspects of life and span all industries. You can have a HUGE impact with your work. 

Freedom to work from anywhere: The idea to work remotly, all you need is a GOOD internet connection. 

Last but not least you got to work on some pretty interesting problems. 

Thank you for reading this is my very first blog!
